Materials:
-joystick
-switch
-button
-button cap (blue)
-3 resistors
-bread board
-bunch of wires


Resources: 
-Rasp Pi to bread board: https://pinout.xyz/
-Omron Button Datasheet: https://omronfs.omron.com/en_US/ecb/products/pdf/en-b3f.pdf
-https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/physical-computing/1

Process Outline
-Found a resource to connect Raspberry Pi to bread board
-Start off simple, let’s just get a program working to print text to screen after button is pressed
-Once this is done, we’ll have a working proof-of-concept of interfacing with the electrical components from the Pi

Button - Omron B3F


Actual process:
-Found manual for Omron button
-Found manual to connect button and matched our wires to the photo
-Created a Python file to test button (it worked!)
-Trying different commands to change states


Code (detect button press):
for button (in file gpio_button.py):
from gpiozero import Button
button = Button(2)

button.wait_for_press()
print('You pushed me')

to run: 
python3 gpio_button.py



Circuit:
GPIO on X,Y,Button for joystick
5v to 5v, Gnd to Gnd
4 to GPIO, 2 to GND


Troubleshooting:
-We keep forgetting to re-connect the ground when testing and spend 5 minutes trying to figure out why our code isn’t working
